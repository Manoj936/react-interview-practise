00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.920
The all new iPhones are here and with

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.240
those comes a lot of butts. I mean

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.759
questions. Questions like how's the

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.759
performance? How's the camera? Do they

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:10.160
heat up? And the most important one, how

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.639
long do they last? Especially the iPhone

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:14.559
air. Well, in this video, we are going

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:16.480
to perform the ultimate battery drain

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.240
test on all the new iPhones. And we'll

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.920
also be comparing them against some of

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.680
the older iPhones. And just so you know,

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.600
there are some surprises. I'm not saying

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.199
this to make you stay, there are some

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.880
shockers. Let's quickly get started

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.119
because we have a lot to cover. First of

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:30.960
all, these are all the iPhones on which

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.640
we are performing the battery drain

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.280
test. There's iPhone 17, 17 Pro Max,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.920
iPhone Air, iPhone 16 Pro Max, iPhone

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.399
16, and the budget iPhone, iPhone 16. In

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:42.480
terms of battery size, 17 Pro Max has

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.280
the biggest 4,832 mAh battery, which is

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.120
a definite improvement from last year.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.800
And for the nonpro, also there's a

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.440
slight jump. iPhone 16 has a 4,5 mAh

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.199
battery, and the Air has the smallest

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:54.719
3,149

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.640
mh battery. At the time of testing, all

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.960
of them are at 100% battery health and

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.640
these are the battery cycle count on

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.480
each of them. Now, as the 17 series

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.000
phones are new, we did not perform

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.159
factory reset on them, but we did reset

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.320
all the 16 series phones. After setting

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.320
up all the phones, we updated all of

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.320
them to the latest iOS version. We

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.240
installed all the required apps. Wi-Fi,

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.840
Bluetooth, and location were kept on,

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.759
and the brightness is set to 500 nits

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.520
with lux meter and volume was set to

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.439
50%. And since there's no option to

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:23.040
toggle the resolutions, they are in

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.799
their default settings only. So, now

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:26.240
that you know the ground rules, let's

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.400
finally begin our testing. Let's go.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.560
First of all, we played a 4K HDR videos

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.240
on all the iPhones for an hour. And for

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.000
this test, we kept the volume on mute.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.840
The test went pretty smoothly and after

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.920
an hour, 16 Pro Max lost the most amount

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.640
of battery and was down to 95% only. The

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.200
17 Pro Max lost only 3% and the iPhone

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.840
Air was also down to 95% but the amount

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.840
of battery lost was not that much. In

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.759
the next round, we decided to take it up

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.399
a notch. So, we recorded a 4K 60 HDR

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:54.399
video from the selfie camera for one

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.479
long hour. This test not only drained

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:57.920
the battery, but also raised the

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.079
temperatures a bit. Unlike its name, Air

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.040
was the hottest at 41° and 16 remained

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.520
the coolest at just 33°. And not just

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.560
that, iPhone 16 lost just 801 mAh

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.319
battery, which is the least, and

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.080
therefore not only won this round, but

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.720
it's also ranking at the top with 75%

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.120
battery still remaining. The 17 Pro Max

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.680
was at the second spot with 74% and as

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.760
expected, iPhone Air is at the bottom

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.080
with just 62% battery left. Now, let's

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.440
move to the third round, which is

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.920
everyone's favorite. Yes, it's 1 hour of

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.239
Instagram real scrolling. And in this

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.160
round, the rankings got shaken up a

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.319
little. For starters, 17 Pro Max got

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.480
back to its first position with 65%

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.200
battery. 16 Pro Max and 16e were sharing

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.360
the second spot with 62% battery. But

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.519
given the battery size, I think 16 was

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.840
doing really well. iPhone 17 and 16 have

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.120
been quite close since the very

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.120
beginning and at the end we have the Air

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.120
with exactly half the battery. After

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.640
watching and recording videos, we

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.400
decided to play surf the surface on all

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.560
the iPhones for 1 hour. And here also

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.800
everything went as expected. The 17 Pro

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.840
Max is still at top with 57% battery. 16

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.239
Pro Max is on second and 16 was sharing

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.400
the third spot with iPhone 17. And at

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.239
the bottom we have iPhone Air with just

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.560
41% battery left. Now, one thing that

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.560
surprised me the most is that iPhone Air

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.040
lost least amount of battery both in IG

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.120
scrolling as well as subway surface.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.800
Now, this surely means that Apple has

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.879
done some extra optimization to ensure

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:22.879
better battery life on their thinnest

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:24.800
iPhone ever, which by the way also has

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.640
the smallest battery. After this test,

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.280
we decided to call it a day because we

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.640
were tired. We turned off all the

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.640
phones, went back home, and continued

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.640
the test next day. Now, when we turned

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.799
all of them on after 14 hours, they all

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.120
lost 2 to 3% battery. And these were the

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.040
remaining battery percentages. Next, we

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.440
ran Google Maps. Now, we obviously can't

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.959
move with our phone, so we randomly

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.879
navigated Delhi streets and highs on

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:48.959
Google Street View. And after 1 hour,

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.959
these are the results. The top two spots

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:52.720
were kind of glued, but there was a lot

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.400
going on at the bottom. iPhone Air was

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.480
still at the bottom with 32% battery,

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.799
but iPhone 16 was extremely close with

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:00.879
just 33% battery, and for the first

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:02.959
time, iPhone 17 was doing better than

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:04.799
16. Things are finally getting

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.159
interesting, and they're going to get

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:07.840
even more dramatic in the next round.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.760
Trust me, they are. In the next round,

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.000
we are streaming 1 hour of video on Plex

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.840
on all the phones. The test went

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.760
extremely smooth and after this test,

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.320
iPhone Air was no longer at the bottom.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.400
It was now replaced by iPhone 16 with

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.960
just 40% battery. See, I told you in the

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.560
beginning, there are some shockers. And

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.720
this right here is the biggest. No one

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.240
would have thought that iPhone Air would

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.400
beat iPhone 16 in battery drain test,

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.400
but here we are. Let's not celebrate

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.320
early because things might change.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.400
Again, the next test is where we run 1

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.240
hour of Google Meet. And here we have

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.160
our first casual event. We started the

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.320
test at 6 hour 26 minutes and all the

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.160
iPhones successfully finished the 1 hour

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.639
mark. But at 7 hours 28 minutes when we

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:48.080
were ending the test and checking the

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.560
battery, iPhone 16 was the first one to

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.720
give up. This was quite surprising

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.040
because everyone including us had their

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.120
money on iPhone Air that it'll be the

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.440
first one to go. But uh it was not the

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.600
case. I think Apple has done some really

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.280
good optimizations here. After this

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.960
round, this is how the leaderboard looks

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.960
like. As expected, the top two spots are

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.440
cemented. No changes here. The iPhone 16

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.680
is at the bottom. It already died and

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.160
iPhone Air still has 2% battery left.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.080
Next, we played Unicorn Evolution for 1

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.759
hour, but iPhone Air obviously couldn't

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:20.080
make it till the end and gave up after 7

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.160
hour 42 minutes. I think it's very

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.080
impressive for such a small battery.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.320
iPhone 16 also waved its hand after

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.800
fighting for 7 hour 57 minutes. And

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.800
after the completion of this round, 17

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.280
Pro Max was still going strong at 19%,

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.840
16 Pro Max got left behind with just 2%

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.320
and iPhone 17 was somehow still standing

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.639
up at just 1%. In the next round, we

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:42.479
played songs on YouTube Music on all the

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:44.160
three phones. After playing for 11

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.800
minutes in just 1%, iPhone 17 went to

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.360
sleep after 8 hour 43 minutes. And just

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.759
9 minutes after that, 16 Pro Max also

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:53.680
called it a day. And once this round was

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.680
over, 17 Pro Max was the only one

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.080
remaining. and it still had 14% battery

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.840
to go. Now that this was the only phone

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.520
that was left, we decided to scroll

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.600
YouTube shots and Instagram reel for 1

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.000
hour each. But still, the phone was not

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.400
giving up. It still had 1% juice left.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.319
And finally, we played a YouTube video.

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:12.880
And after 1 minute 28 seconds, the phone

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.680
finally died after 11 hours 40 minutes

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.000
of SOT. Now, after all said and done,

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.600
this is how the final ranking looks

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.759
like. The 17 Pro Max topped the chart,

00:06:21.759 --> 00:06:23.600
which was kind of expected, but the

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.840
difference between 16 Pro Max and 17 Pro

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.960
Max was a solid 2 hours 48 minutes. And

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.800
not just that, iPhone Air, which has the

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.479
most amount of bets that it'll be the

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:34.400
first one to die, actually outlived

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.120
iPhone 16 by 14 minutes. And that too

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.440
with a much much smaller battery. I

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.360
don't think anyone saw it coming. In

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.800
fact, if you just take a look at the

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.880
battery efficiency, it has increased a

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.960
lot in this year's iPhones compared to

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.360
last year. and iPhone Air is right at

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.520
the top. So overall in terms of battery

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:53.840
size, it might seem like a small minimal

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.600
change, but in terms of battery life,

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.080
it's a huge significant improvement. And

00:06:58.080 --> 00:06:59.680
of course, faster charging speeds are a

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.199
welcome change too. And speaking of

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:02.880
charging, we have also done charging

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.720
speed test and there also we found

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.319
something very interesting. It will be

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:08.000
linked down below. So do check it out

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.759
and don't miss out on that. That's it

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:11.840
for this video. I hope you enjoyed it.
